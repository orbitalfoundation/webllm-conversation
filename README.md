## Version 0

In the first version of the conversational puppet framework we want to:

1) be able to handle user input using a text chat window with limited history
2) pass user prompts to an llm and get back a response
3) break down the response into "breath" segments of about a single breath each
4) have responses be visible to the user
5) allow interruptions and stopping of the llm at any time
6) display state of when the llm is thinking or speaking versus when it is ready for input
7) disambiguate bot 'actions' (smiling, gesturing, pointing) from speaking

We also have to establish a few conventions:

1) Bundling ... ESBuild will do for now although it doesn't have introspection inside dynamically fetched imports so we have to go and specify imports (see 'npm run build and esbuild-make.mjs). The main reason to use esbuild instead of Vite is that Vite has opaque configuration options such as for github pages. See https://esbuild.github.io/ .

2) Bring up web-llm ... Our aspirations are simply to bring up one of their demos and see how it well it works. Older hardware may be challenged. See https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/

3) Bring in Aider ... Aider has become a very helpful tool for scaffolding apps quickly and conversationally. See https://aider.chat/

4) Stage on github and have a static github page. For now we will have the /index.html point to the dist folder generated by esbuild.
